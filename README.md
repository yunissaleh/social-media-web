# social-media-web
This is a social-media-like website that provides the following functionalities:

- New Post: Users who are signed in should be able to write a new text-based post by filling in text into a text area and then clicking a button to submit the post.
- All Posts: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.
- Profile Page: Clicking on a username should load that user’s profile page. 
- Following: The “Following” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they see all posts made by users that the current user follows.
- Pagination: On any page that displays posts, posts should only be displayed 10 on a page. If there are more than ten posts, a “Next” button should appear to take the user to the next page of posts 
- Edit Post: Users should be able to click an “Edit” button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post.
